Overview
---------

Sphinx is a search engine primarily intended to search through
SQL databases, though generally applicable to searching anything else.

Sphinx consists of the following parts:

- full-text indexing/searching library written in C++
- a set of generic utilities built on top of that library:
  - indexer, an utility to creates full-text indices
  - searchd, a daemon to run queries remotely (eg. from PHP/perl scripts)
  - search, a console utility to run queries from command line
- searchd APIs for different languages (currently, PHP)

Features
---------

- high indexing speed (upto 10 MB/sec on modern CPUs);
- high search speed (avg query is under 0.1 sec on 2-4 GB text collections);
- high scalability (upto 100 GB of text, upto 100 M documents on a single CPU);
- distributed searching;
- supports MySQL natively (MyISAM and InnoDB tables are both supported);
- supports PostgreSQL natively;
- supports phrase searching;
- supports phrase proximity ranking, providing very good relevance;
- supports English and Russian stemming;
- supports any number of document fields (weights can be changed on the fly);
