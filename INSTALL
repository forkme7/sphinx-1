Sphinx 0.9.1 installation notes
================================

Supported operating systems
----------------------------

Most modern UNIX systems with a C++ compiler should be able
to compile and run Sphinx without any modifications.

Currently known systems Sphinx has been successfully compiled and
tested on are:

- FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x
- Linux 2.x
- Windows 2000, XP

We hope Sphinx will work on other Unix platforms as well. 
Please report successful platforms via http://shodan.ru/contact/

Required tools
---------------

On UNIX, you will need the following tools to build
and install Sphinx:

- a working C++ compiler. GNU gcc is known to work.
- a good make program. GNU make is known to work.

On Windows, you will need Microsoft Visual C/C++ Studio .NET 2003.
Other compilers/environments will probably work as well, but for the
time being, you will have to build makefile or project file yourself.
